R-testbench
===========



**R-testbench** is a toolkit written in Python that allows the user to 
create a software remote test bench to control an actual electronic test bench remotely.
It relies on the VISA protocol ([Virtual Instrument Software Architecture](http://www.ni.com/visa/)).
The implementation is built on top of [PyVISA](https://pyvisa.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).



Quick start
-----------


To use **R-testbench**, you simply need to import the *rtestbench* Python package.
```python
import rtestbench
```

Tutorial scripts are available [here](./rtestbench/tutorials/).
This is a user-friendly way to start with the toolkit.
