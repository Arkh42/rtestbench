Contributing to R-testbench
===========================



Thank you for investing your time in the R-testbench project!

To make the evolution and the history easier to read and to understand, the project follows some rules.
Please read them carefully before contributing.



Organizing commits
------------------


All commits must have a commit message containing short but understandable information about the code update.

Commit messages are organized with three categories of contributions:
- NEW, for any added new feature (i.e., that was not existing before this commit),
- BUG FIX, with a reference to the fixed bug and the idea/concept/solution used to fix it,
- CHANGE, for any previously existing feature as well as the reason for the change.

If the commit message is *inline* (one feature added/changed or one bug fixed), then it must be written as
```
CATEGORY: message
```
If the commit message is multiline, then it must be written as
```
CATEGORY 1:
- message 1
- message 2

CATEGORY 2:
- message i
- message j
- message k
```
